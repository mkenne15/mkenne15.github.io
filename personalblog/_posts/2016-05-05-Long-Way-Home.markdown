It's about three and half hours into an eight hour flight. The plane jumps a tiny bit as it passes through a rough patch of air. Flying doesn't really suit me, and since the captain has left the seatbelt sign off, I decide to stretch my legs. I always find it easier to deal with turbulence when I'm walking. I stroll down to the back of plane, and look out the window on the emergency exit. The view, quite literally, takes my breath away

I've flown this route a couple of times before, travelling the Atlantic ocean over and back. But I've never seen Greenland before. Never taken the time to look out the window as I was launched past in my flying metal tube. It looked so peaceful, calm and...untouched.

It was about this time during the flight that I began thinking about what I was doing. I've been splitting my life in half over the last few years, flying back and forth between the University of Notre Dame and University College Cork. The friends I've made have been amazing, and the experience is beyond compare for someone in my position, but I can't help but focus on how tired I feel. The constant travelling, packing up my life and lugging my emotions between 2 cities is draining. Even when I'm not travelling, I realise it wears me down, trying to keep in contact with 2 groups of friends on 2 sides of seconds biggest ocean on the planet.

And then I land. And the sight of the main part of the campus (regardless of it being UCC or ND) rejuvenates me. And I feel home. And the tiredness goes away, until the next time I board a flight and move my life around.

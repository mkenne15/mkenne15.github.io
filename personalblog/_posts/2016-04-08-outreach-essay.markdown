*Disclaimer: The following is an assignment I had to do on outreach activities I've done as part of my PhD, so that I can complete the course requirements. It's mostly just a list of what I've done, but I hope it gives people an idea as to the different types of outreach you can do as part of graduate work.*

There’s a strongly held belief that, when a student starts a PhD, their time will be entirely 
devoted to research, and that life won’t exist much outside of the office (or lab, depending on 
their field). Unfortunately, this belief ends up being true for most graduate students. 
Fortunately, it hasn’t been true for me. 
 
Outreach, in it’s simplest form, is explaining your own research to anyone else (a member of 
the public, a colleague who works in a different area, a friend or a family member ­ it doesn’t 
matter). Outreach can take many forms, from public speaking events, to blog posts on the 
internet, to even just a friendly cup of tea at the end of the day with a friend, with the goal 
remaining the same ­ attempting to talk about complex ideas using everyday vocabulary and 
examples. It’s such a simple concept, but don’t let that fool you, for often it is difficult to 
convey the most complex of ideas. 
 
My field of study is astrophysics, which is one of those fields where outreach just seems to 
come naturally, because everyone has some interest (whether it be passing or deep) in 
space and astronomy. I distinctly remember in the first 6 months of my PhD various 
conversations with friends and family where they would be incredibly interested at the start 
of conversations when I was talking in very abstract terms, but as soon as I got too technical, 
they would become bored (which, honestly, I can’t blame them for, astrophysics is a lot more 
tedious than most scientists like to admit). So I began to seek ways to improve my ability to 
explain my research to people without a science background. 
 
In February of 2014, a close friend in the physics department suggested that I enter the 
Famelab competition. Famelab is an international competition based around explaining a 
scientific concept in under 3 minutes, with the option of also using any prop you can carry 
on-stage, and is run in countries all over the world. I presented a 3 minute talk titled “The 
Universe is going to end” at the Munster heats, for which I was awarded 2nd place, and a 
place in the Ireland finals. Being awarded 2nd place was a fantastic confidence boost for me, 
as it encouraged what I had hoped was true when setting off on this adventure ­ that 
complex concepts in astrophysics can be explained in an understanding manner without 
people becoming bored.

The Irish finals, which took place in April 2014, was one of the greatest 2 hours of scientific 
outreach I have ever seen. I didn’t progress beyond the finals, and I have no quarrels with 
that. The winning talks showed me what’s truly possible with outreach ­ the ability to teach 
people important concepts that they’ll remember, while also making the talks thoroughly 
enjoyable.

It was around this time, during April 2014, that I entered Science For All, a competition run 
by the College of SEFS in UCC based around presenting the work of a PhD thesis in 10 
minutes to a general audience. Again, when I entered this, the task seemed easy on paper, 
but difficult in practice. I wanted to try and convince people that measuring the mass of 
neutron stars, and spending large amounts of money on telescopes, was worth something to 
them personally, and that astrophysics goes beyond simply taking pretty pictures. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to do this, how to make neutron stars relatable to people, and 
it paid off. I was awarded 1st place, which I consider to be the greatest achievement of the 
first year of my PhD.

After all of these competitions, I guess you could say I was bitten by an outreach bug. I 
relished the chance to tell people about my work, from groups of school children visiting the 
department to friends simply asking “so what is it you do?”. It was from all of this outreach 
work that my newest hobby emerged ­ radio. In the summer of 2014, my friend who had 
recommended Famelab to me and I were invited onto UCC 98.3 FM to do a 20 minute 
science news segment. From that simple 20 minute segment, 2 different radio shows have 
spawned. 
 
In  Autumn 2014, my friend and I started an hour long science show on UCC 98.3 FM called 
“Black Holes & Revelations”, and when I moved to the US for part of my work, I set up 
another science show called “The Week Unravelled” in the University of Notre Dame, which I 
believe is still going despite my departure from the University in August 2015. These radio 
shows have become a focal point of my PhD, as they require a lot of research and creative 
thinking. Many of the topics we cover are difficult to describe over the radio, and we try to 
cover fields which we aren’t even involved in (we once did a show on rare and neglected 
diseases, despite all of us who worked on the show at the time being physicists). It’s truly 
been fascinating work.

There are other outreach initiatives which I’ve been involved with. I helped set up the first 
Physics Demo Team in the University of Notre Dame during my 12 month period there, 
which is a team of people who travel to local schools to encourage kids to get involved with 
physics. I also entered the Rosse Medal competition at the Institute of Physics in Ireland’s 
Spring meeting in February 2016 (where I qualified for the finals). Most recently, I’ve been 
selected to go to the Lindau Meeting in June 2016, which is a meeting between young 
scientists and Nobel Laureates. This meeting promises to be my outreach highlight for 2016. 
 
There’s one final point I want to touch on in terms of outreach, and that’s the rewards 
inherent to the task. Sometimes, the reward speaks for itself (in terms of winning awards at 
speaking competitions). Other times, the reward is a lot more subtle ­ it may be a small smile 
as someone learns something new that they find interesting, or perhaps it’ll be a heartfelt 
“thank you” as they finally understand a concept they’ve been struggling with. And this 
second result, I think, is far more important.

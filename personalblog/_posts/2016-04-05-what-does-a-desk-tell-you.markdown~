Recently, in between the bursts of productivity that occur between drinking cups of tea, I've been looking at my desk and wondering *"If someone were to see it, what would they think?"*

Thankfully, this question can be answered with a quick gander Starting from left to right, let's do some close ups.

A requirement for any research group that deals with stars and steller evolution, **The Physics of Stars** has been pretty much stuck beside my computer since I resumed office here in August. It's such an important book for us, we have 2 copies of it in the lab (not that they are ever actually read).

Lurking just behind this is my tea cup, which really serves a dual purpose. First, it's the giver of life in the morning, when I'm less than inclined to do work. Second, it lets people know exactly how I feel about being in work in the morning, without the requirement of using valuble energy to speak.

Finally, in the top left, barely visible under the pale blue folder, is a packet of Lemsip. While not very useful in the beautiful Smarch weather we've been having, it definitely deserves an honourable mention for helping save my productivity right before Christmas.

Just as my tea cup was lurking behind the book, I myself lurk on Reddit, and this is evidenced by the Reddit Secret Santa card which is still on my desk. Beside that, hanging out on the speakers, are symbols of 2 very different climates. The snow globe was an attempt to brighten up my desk this year (how original, I know) while the blue-footed booby is a gift from a friend who spent 3 months on the Gal√°pagos islands.

Finally, the pile of papers I don't want to deal with, the stuff that truly shouldn't see the light of day - undergraduate assignments that I still need to correct (they've been sitting there for weeks now, begging my attention, but always just out of sight so I don't worry about them). Infront is a copy of a magazine my mom sent me, with the great Brian Schmidt on the cover. I'll have the privilage of meeting the man himself this summer, so maybe I'll bring this for him to sign.

Finally, there's a small thing in that last photo that's actually very important. The external hard drive. There resides one of 2 of the backups of my current work. For as the saying goes "One backup is no backup"

From June 26th to July 2nd, I was privileged to represent Ireland at the 66th Lindau Nobel Laureate meeting and kindly supported by the Irish Research Council. Spread over several blog posts, I'm going to be describing different aspects of the meeting.

Next Up: The Banter of the 66th Lindau Meeting

## The Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings#

Number 1 most important thing about a conference? Easy, networking. Number 1 way to network? Easy. Have banter. And lots of it. And the 400 young scientists (and the Nobel Laureates) were well up for it.

One of my favourite feelings about the Lindau meeting was, no matter who I ended up talking to, I knew I had a common interest with them - physics. It made approaching people very simple, as I knew before hand that worst case scenario, I could have a 5 minute conversation with them about what they work on. Thinking back over it now, I don't think a single conversation I had went that way. Just like any conversation, every one I had at the Lindau meeting had a natural flow, normally focusing around Brexit or how to encourage more women to do physics. That last topic came up a lot, and rightly so. Interestingly enough, the Lindau meeting had the highest percentage of women at it out of any conference I've been to (I believe the number was 38%). As one friend put it "This is the first physics conference I've been to where there's been a queue for the ladies bathroom".

Over the course of the 5 days, I don't think there were 2 meals in a row where I would end up eating with the same people. Imagine that. 5 days, and every 2 hours meeting and talking to a new group of people. Imagine how exhausting it was! And yet, I don't think I met half of the people at the conference. Even now, browsing through the photos on the Lindau's **[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nobellaureatemeeting/)** page, I see a whole bunch of people who I didn't even see at the meeting!

But the people I did meet were all wonderful. Above are the 4 people who represented Ireland (Kangpeng Wang, Maria O'Brien, Antonio Benedetto and myself) at the meeting. I think this is one of 2 times through the whole week when the 4 of us were together, as otherwise, we were just too busy meeting other people or doing our own thing! On the Monday night, we were shipped (yes, literally shipped) across Lake Constance to Austria, as the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy was hosting us for dinner. There, we were treated to music by **[Federspiel](http://www.feder-spiel.net/w/)** and, afterwards, invited to have dinner with various Laureates. I, alongside various Americans and Germans, ended up sitting with Arthur McDonald, and, as the title of this post suggests, banter was had. And I think that's the power of the Lindau meeting - everyone is there to network, to talk about their research and hear about other peoples. Everyone has the same goal in mind, which means everyone gets on remarkably well with each other.

The following nights were more of the same. Tuesday night, we had a Grill & Chill beside Lake Constance, where various Laureates and the locals from Lindau gathered to enjoy food and talk about the impact of these meetings on the local economy. On Wednesday, Mars, Inc (yes, the company who make the bar) hosted some of us for a dinner to talk about big data. On Thursday, there was the Bavarian evening, where everyone was encouraged to dress in their national outfits (if they had one) (no I did not dress a a leprechaun). And at every social event, science was discussed, #Brexit was dismantled, jokes were told, cultures were thrown head first against each other. And, most importantly, banter was had.

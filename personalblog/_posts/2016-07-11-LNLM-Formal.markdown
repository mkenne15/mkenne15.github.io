From June 26th to July 2nd, I was privileged to represent Ireland at the 66th Lindau Nobel Laureate meeting and kindly supported by the Irish Research Council. Spread over several blog posts, I'm going to be describing different aspects of the meeting.

Next Up: The Lectures of the 66th Lindau Meeting

## The Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings#

The schedule for the week was pretty intense. Every morning, starting at 9 am, the 400 young scientists (plus distinguished guests and media) would gather at the conference venue, which was the Stadttheater. Coincidentally, this theater was the location of the very first meeting in 1951, and it was only by chance that the meeting was held there this year, as the usual site of the conference is currently being renovated. The bell would go at 9 am, which nearly felt like we were being called to class, and then there would be 6 (some times 7) talks by 6 (some times 7) different Laureates before 1pm (with 2 coffee breaks sandwiched in there - coffee transcends academic experience and is required by young scientists and Laureates alike). The talks were all intense, and varied from biophysics to cosmology to climate change to chemistry.

The afternoons were a mixed bag of activity. On Monday and Thursday, at 2pm, there were panels with approx 4 Laureates discussing the future of physics. On Monday, Steven Chu, David Gross, Takaaki Kajita and Carlo Rubbia (along with a live feed to CERN) discussed "Glimpses Beyond The Standard Model", where we were teased with hints about the results of the mysterious 750 GeV diphoton excess. On Thursday, Serge Haroche, Gerardus 't Hooft, William Phillips and David Wineland discussed "Is Quantum Technology the Future of the 21st Century?" (the answer was a resounding maybe). Personally, I found these panel discussions to be one of the more interesting aspect of the meeting, as it all felt less rehearsed - nearly like just listening to a casual conversation between friends at times (a conversation between people with the collective IQ of a small country mind you).

Whenever there wasn't a panel in the afternoon, the Laureates who spoke in the morning would run discussion sessions, where people could come and ask questions about the talks, or about life in general. Again, I found these sessions far more interesting than the talks themselves - for at these discussions, I got a better insight into what makes a Nobel Laureate. The answer? Nothing in particular. All the Laureates were very different (and incredible relaxed, willing to discuss anything and hand out advice), and the paths they took to receive the medal were as varied as the colours in a bag of M&Ms. Typically, there were no more than 40 young scientists at any of the discussion sessions, which gave these sessions a very casual feel (no media personal were allowed into these sessions either, adding to that casual feel).

The 66th meeting was also a special meeting, with the first ever Heidelberg lecture being delivered. Since there is no Nobel prize in mathematics or computer science (CS), there is never a Lindau meeting dedicated to these subjects. Instead, maths and CS have a separate meeting - the Heidelberg Laureate Forum. To promote collaborations between these fields, the decision was made last year that every year, a Lindau Nobel Laureate participant would give the Lindau lecture at the Heidelberg meeting, and a Heidelberg participant would give the Heidelberg lecture at the Lindau meeting. This year, Vinton G. Cerf, father of the Internet and Google's Chief Internet Evangelist, delivered a lecture on the Wednesday night on how the Internet has evolved. It was truly remarkable to hear him talk about the beginning of the Internet, and how they underestimated its impact.

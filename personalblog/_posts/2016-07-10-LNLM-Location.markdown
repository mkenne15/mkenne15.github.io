From June 26th to July 2nd, I was honoured to represent Ireland at the 66th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting (LNLM) and kindly supported by the Irish Research Council. Spread over several blog posts, I'm going to be describing different aspects of the meeting.

First Up: Location and Background

## The Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings

The Lindau meetings have taken place since 1951. The original meeting, which had a total of 7 Nobel Laureates in attendance, was meant to be part of a European initiative of post-war reconciliation among scientists. It apparently worked, because the meetings have continued ever since. The idea of the meetings is, for a week in June, about 30-40 Nobel Laureates will meet with about 400 young scientists to talk about...well...science! The topic of the meetings rotates every year, so that some years it'll focus on chemistry (and mostly Nobel Laureates in Chemistry will be invited), other years it'll be physics, and every now and again there will be a general meeting. The 66th meeting focused around physics.

The meetings are held on the beautiful, historic island of Lindau, which lies on Lake Constance in southwest Germany. As far as venues for a conference go, this has by far been my favourite. Every morning, I woke up to postcard worthy views of the lake, with the Alps in the distance. The temperature was a balmy 25 degrees every day, making after-lunch ice creams a necessity (my weapon of choice was a scoop of hazelnut on top of a scoop of white chocolate - better known as the Haselnuss und wei√üe Schokolade special). The island itself is very small, with a stroll across the length of the island taking no more than 15 minutes, which gave the whole conference a very homely feel - everywhere I walked during the week, I could see people wearing their conference badges. It honestly felt like we took over the island for the entirety of the conference (I learned during the BBQ on the Tuesday night that the locals don't mind this. In fact, they love having so many people come to their town).

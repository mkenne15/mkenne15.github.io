**Abstract:**
The "evolved main-sequence (EMS)" channel is thought to contribute significantly to the population of AM CVn-type systems in the Galaxy, and also to the number of cataclysmic variables (CVs) detected below the period minimum for hydrogen rich systems. CSS 120422:J111127+571239 was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey in 2012 April. Its period was found to be 56 minutes, well below the minimum, and the optical spectrum is clearly depleted in hydrogen relative to helium, but still has two orders of magnitude more hydrogen than AM CVn stars. Doppler tomography of the HÎ± line hinted at a spiral structure existing in the disk. Here we present spectroscopy of CSS 120422:J111127+571239 using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph FUV instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope and using the MODS spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope. The UV spectrum shows Si iv, N v, and He ii, but no detectable C iv. The anomalous nitrogen/carbon ratio is seen in a small number of other CVs and confirms a unique binary evolution. We also present and compare the optical spectrum of V418 Ser and advocate that it is also an EMS system.

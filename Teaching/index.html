				</span><br /><br />
			</div>
			<b>Module Objective</b>: To introduce students to a variety of topics in astronomy and special relativity.<br />
			<b>Module Content</b>: Celestial coordinate systems, parallax distance determination, the virial theorem; orbits, tidal forces, formation and structure of the solar system, blackbody radiation; Doppler shifts of spectral lines, special relativity & astrophysical applications (cosmic rays, astrophysical jets).<br />
			<b>Learning Outcomes</b>: On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:
			<ul>
					<li>(1) show familiarity with equatorial celestial coordinates, parallax distance determination and the magnitude brightness scale,</li>
					<li>(2) know the virial theorem and how to apply it, including an ability to identify situations where it is not applicable,</li>
					<li>(3) show familiarity with Newton's shell theorem and how to apply it in astrophysical problems,</li>
					<li>(4) show familiarity with the properties of elliptical, parabolic and hyperbolic orbits and their relationship to the total energy and angular momentum of an orbiting body,</li>
					<li>(5) explain the origin of tidal forces and their various consequences for orbiting bodies,</li>
					<li>(6) demonstrate knowledge of the basic properties of the solar system and theories for its formation and structure,</li>
					<li>(7) demonstrate an understanding of the properties of blackbody radiation and the distinction between thermal/non-thermal radiation,</li>
					<li> explain the origin of spectral line emission, Doppler line shifts and line-broadening mechanisms,.<br /></li>
			</ul>
		<b>Assessment</b>: Total Marks 100: Formal Written Examination 80 marks; Continuous Assessment 20 marks (10 assignments, 2 marks each).<br />

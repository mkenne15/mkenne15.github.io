Hi! I'm Mark, and I've recently graduated with a PhD in the field of astrophysics. During my PhD, I worked between University College Cork and the University of Notre Dame. 

This website is a collection of many things - a podcast I appear on (Black Holes & Revelations), my current research publications and a personal blog. I also co-host the science podcast **Science of the Lambs[lambs.science]**

Some day I'll flesh out this page more...
